# Reviewing My Learning History


**What habits have you developed over the years that you feel might hinder you as a learner during WDI?**               
My worst habit is letting my mind wander. Whether I'm reading or listening to a lecture, my mind will drift to what's going on in other areas of my life. 




**How can you combat or minimize those habits' effects on your experience at General Assembly?**                                   
Whenever a thought pops into my head that is not realated to the task at hand, I block it out. I re-direct my focus to what i'm doing. 



**Can you think of any strategies to increase the output or viability of these approaches in the context of WDI? (No idea is too crazy).**                                                     
Going to bed earlier. No caffeine after 12pm. Getting up two hours before I have to be in class to eat breakfast, have some coffee. If I've already been up and about when I arrive to class, it's much easier to focus.


**What is your greatest fear as a WDI student?**                     
My greatest fear is falling behind.

**Is this fear valid? If so, does it serve you as someone learning to program?**
This fear is valid. It does not serve me as learn to program.
